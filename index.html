        <h1>Phorim's Website</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm not sure if I will do anything with this website, but I might expand it</p>
        <h2>Who am i?</h2>
        <p>I try to keep my personal details private. I am an amateur polish programmer, you never heard of me, because i'm no one</p>
        <h2>Why did i make this website?</h2>
        <p>I will use it in the future (once i find a use), but for now it will be in this format.
        <h2>What am i working on?</h2>
        <p>Not much, i got a little project called "Downtown Sector" on youtube, but i don't plan on it to be big. I also like to make some small workshop items on steam. Also im doing fuck all, cuz im a lazy fuck with no motivation and i quit making a project after a few days. (This is a reason why i dont have any big projects, all of them are W.I.P. or i stopped liking the idea)</p>
        <h2>Let's move on from self hatred. What can you expect from me?</h2>
        <p>Nothing currently, i got no goals, but you can follow me on steam just incase i actually do something with my life for once, even if it's goning to be only virtual</p>

        <h2>News! (11.07 11:11 [UTC +2])</h2>
        <p>I decided to add this website to my steam profile so i might work on it to make it pretty, actually i will start doing it now. If you somehow see this before the big change (thank you for checking out my profile on steam btw <3), then you can check later (MAYBE this evening)</p>
